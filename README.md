# Fardad-Ahmed-Project
I created an app for friend groups to play any game with one another, with a matchmaking and rating system. This allows players to compete for a spot on the leaderboard and creates balanced teams. This project was only possible by using dynamic allocation of memory since the player and ratings are not static.
